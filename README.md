# Lunar

#### What is Lunar?

Lunar is a programming language and compiler pair which makes designing and implementing genetic algorithms easy. Lunar's custom command structure and simulation environment make it perfect for real-time simulation, and offers many different visualization tools.

#### How does Lunar work?

Lunar is built in order to adapt to different and unique genetic simulation environments. The core engine of Lunar's iterative evolutionary process is the **Genetic Algorithm**. The genetic algorithm is tasked with transfering genomes from one generation to the next, preserving the knowlegde gained by past generations by passing down genome bits through 2 parent breeding.

#### Using Lunar with a Linker

The upside of Lunar's bare-bones design is that it is able to be used with custom linker's, written in the Lunar programming language, and ending in a *.moon* extention.
